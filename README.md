## About

This project is a simple inventory management system that uses **Elasticsearch** to index and search inventory items. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on inventory items and integrates Elasticsearch for efficient searching. The project also includes tests written using **Pytest** to verify the correctness of the implementation.

---

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on inventory items.
- **Elasticsearch Integration**: Leverage Elasticsearch to store and search inventory data efficiently.
- **Pytest for Testing**: Ensure the reliability of the application through unit and integration tests.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.7+**: The backend of the application is built using Python 3.7 or higher.
- **Elasticsearch**: Used as the primary search engine to store and search inventory items.
- **Pytest**: Testing framework used for writing unit and integration tests.
- **FastAPI** (optional): If applicable, FastAPI is used to build the REST API endpoints for the inventory management system.
